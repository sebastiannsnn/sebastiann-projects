Proverbs Flashcards Program
Project Description:

2. The Proverbs Flashcards program is an interactive tool designed to help users learn and recall common proverbs. It presents the user with a partial proverbial phrase, with the last word missing, and asks them to guess the missing word. After the user submits their guess, the program checks whether the guess is correct and provides immediate feedback.
Features:

    Random Proverbs: A proverb is randomly selected from a predefined dictionary of common proverbs.
    User Interaction: The user is prompted to guess the missing word in the phrase.
    Immediate Feedback: The program informs the user whether their guess is correct or provides the correct answer if the guess is wrong.
    Repeatable Testing: Users can choose to display new flashcards or exit the program using a simple command interface.

How It Works:

    The program defines a dictionary of common proverbs, each with a missing last word (e.g., "A rolling stone gathers no": "moss").
    When the user selects to show a flashcard (s), a random proverb is selected, and the user is prompted to guess the missing word.
    The user's guess is checked against the correct answer, and feedback is given. If correct, the user is congratulated; if incorrect, the correct word is shown.
    The user can continue testing themselves or quit the program (q).

Technologies Used:

    Python: The program is written entirely in Python and uses simple constructs such as dictionaries, random selections, and user input.
    Random Library: The program leverages the random.choice() function to select a random proverb from the dictionary.
