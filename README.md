The system is modular, with different classes handling specific tasks such as tracking, quoting prices, and calculating shipping for larger freight items.
Skills Used:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented classes (Parcel, Freight, TrackedParcel, and PriceQuoter) to handle different aspects of the shipping process.
    Class Inheritance: Extended Parcel functionality to create TrackedParcel for tracking shipments.
    Data Handling and Calculation: Managed attributes like weight, dimensions, and cost calculations dynamically.
    File Input/Output: Processed shipping data and configurations.
    Java Programming: Utilized Java for system architecture, using OOP principles to organize and manage tasks efficiently.

2. Proverbs Flashcards Program
Description:

An interactive Python flashcard game that helps users learn proverbs. The program presents users with a proverb missing its last word, prompting them to guess the correct word. Immediate feedback is provided for both correct and incorrect guesses, creating an engaging learning experience.
Skills Used:

    Python Programming: Created a console-based interactive application in Python.
    Dictionaries and Data Structures: Stored and retrieved proverbs using Python dictionaries.
    Randomization and User Input: Used the random module to shuffle proverbs and gather user input dynamically.
    Error Handling: Managed user input and provided appropriate feedback for correct or incorrect answers.
    Interactive Programming: Developed a user-friendly interface that interacts with the user through the console.
