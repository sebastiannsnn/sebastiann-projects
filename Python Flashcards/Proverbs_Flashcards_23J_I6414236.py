"""
This interactive flashcard program tests the user's knowledge of proverbial phrases.
Upon request, it presents the user with an incomplete proverbial phrase, missing the last word,
and asks the user to guess the missing word. The program then checks the user's guess against
the correct answer, offering congratulations for correct guesses or providing the correct
word for incorrect guesses. Users can continuously ask for new flashcards or choose to exit the program.

        Upon receiving the user's guess, the function checks its correctness against the actual
