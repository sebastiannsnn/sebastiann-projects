100 Days of Learning TensorFlow
Description:

This project is a journey through 100 lessons of learning TensorFlow, where each day involves tackling a new concept, technique, or project related to TensorFlow and machine learning. The goal is to build a solid foundation in TensorFlow, progressing from basic concepts to more advanced applications, and culminating in a comprehensive final project. The lessons are structured to gradually increase in complexity, with weekly reviews to adjust difficulty if necessary.
Skills Used:

    TensorFlow Basics: Learning how to create and manipulate tensors, perform basic mathematical operations, and understand core TensorFlow functionalities.
    Deep Learning Models: Gradually building up skills in designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models like neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
    Data Preprocessing: Exploring techniques for handling and preparing data for machine learning, including feature scaling, normalization, and augmentation.
    Model Optimization: Learning advanced techniques to optimize models, including hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
    Python Programming: Developing code in Python, utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data visualization and analysis.

Structure:

    Daily Lessons: Each day focuses on a specific topic or challenge, ensuring steady progress.
    Weekly Reviews: Weekly checkpoints assess progress and adjust the difficulty level based on the performance and understanding of the lessons.
    Final Project: At the end of the 100 days, a comprehensive final project will be developed, integrating all the concepts learned throughout the lessons.
